ChiptuneImporter
================

**ChiptuneImporter** is a [Spotlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_%28software%29)
plugin for importing metadata (like title, copyright, artist...) from chiptune
files.


Features
--------

The plugin supports the following file formats:

 - sid 
 - nsf
 - gbs
 - spc
 - Most of the *sf formats (2sf, gsf, psf, psf2, usf...)

Note that metadata of existing files will not appear immediately after the
plugin is installed, because Spotlight has to reindex them all first.
  
### Supported OS X versions

QLWindowsApps was tested on OS X Mavericks and later (included OS X El Capitan).
