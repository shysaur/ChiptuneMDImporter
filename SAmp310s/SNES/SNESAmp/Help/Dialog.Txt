SNESAmp v3.10 Dialog Translation
=============================================================================

When translating, remember that there is limited space on the forms.  Use the
shortest words possible in your language.  You do not have to use exact
translations, just descriptions that mean the same thing.

The labels on buttons, radio buttons, and check boxes can only be one line
of text.  All other labels can be on two lines, if they need to be.

Words that have an underscore (_) in them are displayed on buttons or in
menus.  The underscore is placed before the letter that is a shortcut to that
command.  Please place an underscore in your traslation next to the letter
you want to be the shortcut key.
